# This script is all about a simple rust calulator 
## **It perform just simple arthmetics calculation like addtion,subraction , multiplication and division, modulus and exponent,**



# This is how to use this script
Firstly, you have to clone this repository, so life made easy, you can just copy this code and past it into your terminal 
```bash
git clone  https://github.com/chojuninengu/rust_basic_calculator.git
```
Congratulations
you will then need to run this command to initialize the startup script, you can use this command to make this 'start.sh' executable
```bash
chmod +x start.sh
```
Thats good, so you will then need to execute the startup script from above using this command
```bash
./start.sh
```
The startup script will create the container and then enter into the container, from there, you can then run this command to run the script 
```bash
cargo run
```
so when you are done, to exit the container, use this command 
```bash
exit
```
Then to enter back the container, you need to start from the beginning
